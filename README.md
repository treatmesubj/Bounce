# Bounce
Uses Windows API to interface with OS and threading to concurrently run multiple I/O-bound tasks.

Audibly greets logged in user and creates an alert window, which bounces around the desktop.

Changes cursor and moves in circle for ~20 seconds.

For extra fun, build an executable, embed in a Word document, and send to a friend.
